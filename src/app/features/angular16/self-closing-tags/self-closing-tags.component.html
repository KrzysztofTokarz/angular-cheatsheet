<p>
  Starting from Angular 16 we can use self closing tags for components
</p>
<p>So we can write <strong>{{tagBefore}}</strong> instead of <strong>{{tagAfter}}</strong></p>

<p class="mt-4">Check code example in "<strong>app/features/angular16/self-closing-tags/self-closing-tags.component.html</strong>"</p>

<!-- this is how we can use it -->
<app-self-closing-component class="mt-5" />
